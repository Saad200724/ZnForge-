The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- The build failed because the Vite binary could not be found when Netlify ran the build. See the failed build command and the error: [line 60](#L60) — [line 63](#L63).
- This normally happens when the package providing the "vite" CLI is not installed in the environment Netlify used for the build (either vite is not listed in package.json, or Netlify omitted devDependencies during install so vite wasn't installed).

Required verification (do this first)
1. Verify that vite is listed in your repository's package.json (devDependencies or dependencies). Example file in your repo: https://github.com/Saad200724/ZnForge-/blob/main/package.json
2. Verify package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) were committed to the repo.

Solution (pick one of the options below depending on what you find)

Option A — vite is missing from package.json
- Add vite to your project (as a dev dependency is typical):
```bash
# from your project root (locally)
npm install --save-dev vite
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add vite"
git push
```
- Re-deploy on Netlify.

Option B — vite is present in devDependencies but Netlify skipped devDependencies
- Netlify can skip devDependencies if NODE_ENV=production or install flags omit dev deps. To make Netlify install devDependencies, add this to netlify.toml (or set the NPM_FLAGS env var in Netlify UI):
```toml
[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--include=dev"
```
- Commit netlify.toml (if you change it) and redeploy. This keeps vite as a devDependency while ensuring it's installed during the build.

Option C — Move vite to regular dependencies (quick fix)
- If you prefer to ensure vite is always installed, install it as a dependency:
```bash
npm install --save vite
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Move vite to dependencies"
git push
```
- Re-deploy.

Quick temporary workaround
- Change your build command in netlify.toml to use npx so it will fetch and run vite even if not locally installed:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npx vite build"
```
This is not recommended long-term (adds network fetch at build time); better to add/enable the dependency as above.

Why this fixes it
- The error ("vite: not found") means Netlify's environment couldn't find the vite CLI binary. Ensuring the package is present in package.json and that Netlify installs devDependencies (or moving vite into dependencies) makes the vite binary available during the build.

If you discover the issue is actually a Node version mismatch, update Netlify's Node version per Netlify docs: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript
